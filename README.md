## üî• Features & Functionalities

### üîê Authentication & Security
- Implements authentication mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive files and actions.
- Supports **PIN-based authentication** or **face recognition** for critical operations.
- Ensures unauthorized users cannot perform system-level actions.

### üé§ Dual Input Modes
- Supports **both voice and text commands** for maximum flexibility.
- Users can choose between **hands-free interaction** or **text-based execution**.

### üß† Query Translation with NLU
- Uses **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** to interpret user commands.
- Translates queries into executable system calls.

**Example:**
- **User Command:** "Create a folder named 'Projects'."
- **Execution:** Automatically creates the folder with the specified name at the designated path.

### üìÇ File Management via System Calls
- Uses **system calls** for **faster CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) execution**.
- Enables efficient **file and folder management** (create, delete, move, rename).
- Includes **security features** to restrict access to private or sensitive files.

### ‚öôÔ∏è System Settings Control
- Controls settings like **volume, brightness, and network** using Python‚Äôs `os` and `subprocess` modules.
- Allows users to modify system settings directly through voice or text.

**Example:**
- **Command:** "Set brightness to 80%."
- **Execution:** Adjusts the system brightness accordingly.

### ü§ñ Seamless Chatbot Integration
- Both **file management** and **system settings** can be controlled via the chatbot interface.
- Provides **real-time feedback** confirming executed actions.
